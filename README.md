# MicrosoftPaintClone
A WinForms MicrosoftPaint Clone With Github 

## Description
A Single Winforms MicrosoftPaint Clone application, which is used by me for educational purposes. My goal is to better understand\n
how GitHub/Git and Winforms Work. I will also probably utilize technologies such as seriliazation for some of the tasks. 

## RoadMap
